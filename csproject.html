    <!-- Project Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We were initially told by the client that the goal of this project was to redesign the frontend of the website and make the user experience "modern and responsive".
            The main priority was the frontend, but the client was also interested in adding a new feature if the time allowed.
            Due to some issues learning the tech stack and getting the project to run locally, we spent Sprint 1 designing the frontend in Figma while we worked with the client to run the project on our machines.
            We spent Sprint 2 actually coding and implementing this frontend design in the code, as well as adding user authentication, and we spent Sprint 3 implementing the new Sports Betting feature to the page.
        </p>

    <!-- Starting Point / Initial State -->
    <section id="initial-state">
        <h2>Initial State</h2>
        <p>The initial state of the project we were given was a single index page that contained a variety of forms and buttons to access different pages in the project. This page had a simple design, and the backend worked the way it was supposed to.
            Our goal was to redesign the website so that it utilized the navbar to navigate between pages, and had a new organization that was simpler to use. We also wanted to remove the unnecessary pages that each contained a different form. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The project uses Django, Docker, Umami, and Nginx primarily to run. To run this locally, we had to follow the README file provided by the client, but we had some issues with machine compatibility and certificates. The next group will likely need to initially work closely with the client to run the project locally on their machine.</li>
            <li>The primary functions of the initial website are: see machine learning predictions with cybercoaches, view coach stats, visualize conference realignment, view team rankings, and sign up for email updates.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Changes and Modifications -->
    <section id="changes-made">
        <h2>Changes and Modifications</h2>
        <p>The primary changes involved a complete frontend redesign, structure changes, user authentication, and the introduction of a betting feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing the frontend involved changing the HTML files and making custom JS and CSS files for each page.</li>
            <li>Changing the website structure included creating a navbar with page links, individual pages with less clicking required, and new backend form structures to ensure that all of the data was passed to each page properly.</li>
            <li>The database was redesigned to better use users for authentication. It was also redesigned for the betting features added.</li>
            <li>The CFB betting feature was added. This was a new page with new views and actions. CFBDB and the Odds API were used.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How to Edit and Work on the Project -->
    <section id="how-to-edit">
        <h2>How to Edit and Work on the Project</h2>
        <p>Once the project is successfully running locally on your machine and you can see it on localhost with the database working, the project can be modifed simply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To edit the frontend, navigate to the HTML page that you want to edit and the corresponding CSS/JS pages. These can be edited there. Keep in mind that parts of the actual pages are put together when the project is composed with Docker and Django. To see any changes when they are made, simply run "docker compose up" and go to localhost in a browser. You may need to clear your cache to see the changes.</li>
            <li>To edit any backend forms or actions, go to views.py. It is best to look at similar views and actions to understand how to interact with the database and the frontend with Django. This is similar to an MVC structure.</li>
            <li>To create a new page, start by duplicating an HTML page. This page will need to have a corresponding view in views.py, and it will need to be included in urls.py so that the page can be accessed.</li>
            <li>For any database migrations, "docker compose build" must be re-run before seeing the changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Current State of the Project -->
    <section id="current-state">
        <h2>Current State of the Project</h2>
        <p>The current state of the project, including functionality, known issues, and pending work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, the Cybercoaches, Coach Stats, and other similar features work as expected. These pages are mobile compatible and have been redesigned.</li>
            <li>The new betting feature works if the database has been updated with that week's games. As of now, the python script to update the database needs to be run manually every week. There is one script to get that week's games, and there is one script to get last week's scores and update the outcomes of all user bets.</li>
            <li>The primary pending feature is the implementation of the scheduler. This has been started, but it is not fully implemented.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="scheduler">
        <h2>The Scheduler</h2>
        <p>
        The scheduler was implemented with the celery and celery-beat python module. The reason we began implementing a scheduler that was to run update_scores.py populate_games.py every week. 
        To enact this change, a celery.py file needed to be added to the myproject directory and a tasks.py to the root of the pygskin_webapp directory. Also, small things needed to be tweaked in the docker-compose.yml, the requirements.txt, Dockerfile and the settings.py. 
        Technically, the scheduler works in the scheduler branch right now, meaning it runs the defined task in tasks.py, but once I got the scheduler to work the Django forms on the webpage would no longer run. 
        That will be the first thing you will need to fix before you get it to run the other scripts. Then something will need to be defined in tasks.py to run the scripts on a weekly basis. Use docker compose logs to debug. 
        One of the main errors I get when running it is that it has a problem loading static files which leads me to believe in the docker-entrypoint.sh there could be a problem with this line: “python manage.py collectstatic –noinput”

    <section id="database">
        <h2>The Database</h2>
        <p>
            The Postgres database has nine different tables. All of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>. The <i>Coach</i> and <i>Cybercoach</i> tables store the coach data for the Cybercoach 
            select feature of the website. The <i>Subscriber</i> table stores all information about a subscriber. The <i>User</i> table is Django’s built-in User feature. This table stores similar 
            information to Subscriber, however, the user table is used for login/out, as well as keeping track of user betting and user credits. The <i>Game</i> and <i>GameScore</i> tables 
            store all information needed about a game for the betting feature. The information that is stored on each of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>. The <i>Bet</i>, 
            <i>BettingTransaction</i>, and <i>UserCredit</i> tables are used to keep track of the bets that users make, if they won, lost, or pushed the bet, and adjust credits. 
            The information that is stored on each of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="forms">
        <h2>Changed Forms</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>Subscriber</i> form was kept very similar to the original form. The only new feature is that the form now adds a user to the <i>User</i> table 
            and assigns that user with credits in the <i>UserCredits</i> table. All of this is done automatically when a user signs up on the website. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="views">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>login_view()</b>: view was added for the new login page. This view uses Django’s built-in user authentication feature. 
                The view limits the user to 5 login attempts and will lock the user out of their account for 5 minuets if they exceed these attempts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>profile_view()</b>: view was added to display all of the user’s information on the profile page. This view is only accessible if the user is logged in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>place_bets()</b>: view was added to display all of the games that a user can bet on. This will be displayed on the place bets page.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>place_bet()</b>: view is called when a user submits a bet. This view will put all of the necessary information for that user’s bet in the database.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="scripts">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Populate_games.py</b>: is a script that is used to populate all the games and the data needed for betting in the database. 
                This script makes calls to the College Football Database (CFBDB) and the Odds-API. The API keys for both should be in your .env file. 
                Variable names and how to pull information for each of these APIs can be found in the documentation of their corresponding websites.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Update_scores.py</b>: is a script that is used to all the scores for each game and adjust the credits for each user. 
                This script should be run at the end of the week after all the games for that week have been played. This script only uses the CFBDB API. 
            </li>
        </ul>
