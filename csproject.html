    <!-- Project Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We were initially told by the client that the goal of this project was to redesign the frontend of the website and make the user experience "modern and responsive".
            The main priority was the frontend, but the client was also interested in adding a new feature if the time allowed.
            Due to some issues learning the tech stack and getting the project to run locally, we spent Sprint 1 designing the frontend in Figma while we worked with the client to run the project on our machines.
            We spent Sprint 2 actually coding and implementing this frontend design in the code, as well as adding user authentication, and we spent Sprint 3 implementing the new Sports Betting feature to the page.

    <!-- Starting Point / Initial State -->
    <section id="initial-state">
        <h2>Initial State</h2>
        <p>The initial state of the project we were given was a single index page that contained a variety of forms and buttons to access different pages in the project. This page had a simple design, and the backend worked the way it was supposed to.
            Our goal was to redesign the website so that it utilized the navbar to navigate between pages, and had a new organization that was simpler to use. We also wanted to remove the unnecessary pages that each contained a different form. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The project uses Django, Docker, Umami, and Nginx primarily to run. To run this locally, we had to follow the README file provided by the client, but we had some issues with machine compatibility and certificates. The next group will likely need to initially work closely with the client to run the project locally on their machine.</li>
            <li>The primary functions of the initial website are: see machine learning predictions with cybercoaches, view coach stats, visualize conference realignment, view team rankings, and sign up for email updates.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Changes and Modifications -->
    <section id="changes-made">
        <h2>Changes and Modifications</h2>
        <p>The primary changes involved a complete frontend redesign, structure changes, user authentication, and the introduction of a betting feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing the frontend involved changing the HTML files and making custom JS and CSS files for each page.</li>
            <li>Changing the website structure included creating a navbar with page links, individual pages with less clicking required, and new backend form structures to ensure that all of the data was passed to each page properly.</li>
            <li>The database was redesigned to better use users for authentication. It was also redesigned for the betting features added.</li>
            <li>The CFB betting feature was added. This was a new page with new views and actions. CFBDB and the Odds API were used.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How to Edit and Work on the Project -->
    <section id="how-to-edit">
        <h2>How to Edit and Work on the Project</h2>
        <p>Once the project is successfully running locally on your machine and you can see it on localhost with the database working, the project can be modifed simply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To edit the frontend, navigate to the HTML page that you want to edit and the corresponding CSS/JS pages. These can be edited there. Keep in mind that parts of the actual pages are put together when the project is composed with Docker and Django. To see any changes when they are made, simply run "docker compose up" and go to localhost in a browser. You may need to clear your cache to see the changes.</li>
            <li>To edit any backend forms or actions, go to views.py. It is best to look at similar views and actions to understand how to interact with the database and the frontend with Django. This is similar to an MVC structure.</li>
            <li>To create a new page, start by duplicating an HTML page. This page will need to have a corresponding view in views.py, and it will need to be included in urls.py so that the page can be accessed.</li>
            <li>For any database migrations, "docker compose build" must be re-run before seeing the changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Current State of the Project -->
    <section id="current-state">
        <h2>Current State of the Project</h2>
        <p>The current state of the project, including functionality, known issues, and pending work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, the Cybercoaches, Coach Stats, and other similar features work as expected. These pages are mobile compatible and have been redesigned.</li>
            <li>The new betting feature works if the database has been updated with that week's games. As of now, the python script to update the database needs to be run manually every week. There is one script to get that week's games, and there is one script to get last week's scores and update the outcomes of all user bets.</li>
            <li>The primary pending feature is the implementation of the scheduler. This has been started, but it is not fully implemented.</li>
        </ul>
