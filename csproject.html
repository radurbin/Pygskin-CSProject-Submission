    <!-- Project Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We were initially told by the client that the goal of this project was to redesign the frontend of the website and make the user experience "modern and responsive".
            The main priority was the frontend, but the client was also interested in adding a new feature if the time allowed.
            Due to some issues learning the tech stack and getting the project to run locally, we spent Sprint 1 designing the frontend in Figma while we worked with the client to run the project on our machines.
            We spent Sprint 2 actually coding and implementing this frontend design in the code, as well as adding user authentication, and we spent Sprint 3 implementing the new Sports Betting feature to the page.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Starting Point / Initial State -->
    <section id="initial-state">
        <h2>Initial State</h2>
        <p>The initial state of the project we were given was a single index page that contained a variety of forms and buttons to access different pages in the project. This page had a simple design, and the backend worked the way it was supposed to.
            Our goal was to redesign the website so that it utilized the navbar to navigate between pages, and had a new organization that was simpler to use. We also wanted to remove the unnecessary pages that each contained a different form. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The project uses Django, Docker, Umami, and Nginx primarily to run. To run this locally, we had to follow the README file provided by the client, but we had some issues with machine compatibility and certificates. The next group will likely need to initially work closely with the client to run the project locally on their machine.</li>
            <li>The primary functions of the initial website are: see machine learning predictions with cybercoaches, view coach stats, visualize conference realignment, view team rankings, and sign up for email updates.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Changes and Modifications -->
    <section id="changes-made">
        <h2>Changes and Modifications</h2>
        <p>The primary changes involved a complete frontend redesign, structure changes, user authentication, and the introduction of a betting feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing the frontend involved changing the HTML files and making custom JS and CSS files for each page.</li>
            <li>Changing the website structure included creating a navbar with page links, individual pages with less clicking required, and new backend form structures to ensure that all of the data was passed to each page properly.</li>
            <li>The database was redesigned to better use users for authentication. It was also redesigned for the betting features added.</li>
            <li>The CFB betting feature was added. This was a new page with new views and actions. CFBDB and the Odds API were used.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How to Edit and Work on the Project -->
    <section id="how-to-edit">
        <h2>How to Edit and Work on the Project</h2>
        <p>Once the project is successfully running locally on your machine and you can see it on localhost with the database working, the project can be modifed simply.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To edit the frontend, navigate to the HTML page that you want to edit and the corresponding CSS/JS pages. These can be edited there. Keep in mind that parts of the actual pages are put together when the project is composed with Docker and Django. To see any changes when they are made, simply run "docker compose up" and go to localhost in a browser. You may need to clear your cache to see the changes.</li>
            <li>To edit any backend forms or actions, go to views.py. It is best to look at similar views and actions to understand how to interact with the database and the frontend with Django. This is similar to an MVC structure.</li>
            <li>To create a new page, start by duplicating an HTML page. This page will need to have a corresponding view in views.py, and it will need to be included in urls.py so that the page can be accessed.</li>
            <li>For any database migrations, "docker compose build" must be re-run before seeing the changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Current State of the Project -->
    <section id="current-state">
        <h2>Current State of the Project</h2>
        <p>The current state of the project, including functionality, known issues, and pending work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, the Cybercoaches, Coach Stats, and other similar features work as expected. These pages are mobile compatible and have been redesigned.</li>
            <li>The new betting feature works if the database has been updated with that week's games. As of now, the python script to update the database needs to be run manually every week. There is one script to get that week's games, and there is one script to get last week's scores and update the outcomes of all user bets.</li>
            <li>The primary pending feature is the implementation of the scheduler. This has been started, but it is not fully implemented.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="scheduler">
        <h2>The Scheduler</h2>
        <p>
            The scheduler was implemented with the celery and celery-beat python module. The reason we began implementing a scheduler that was to run update_scores.py populate_games.py every week. 
            To enact this change, a celery.py file needed to be added to the myproject directory and a tasks.py to the root of the pygskin_webapp directory. Also, small things needed to be tweaked in the docker-compose.yml, the requirements.txt, Dockerfile and the settings.py. 
            Technically, the scheduler works in the scheduler branch right now, meaning it runs the defined task in tasks.py, but once I got the scheduler to work the Django forms on the webpage would no longer run. 
            That will be the first thing you will need to fix before you get it to run the other scripts. Then something will need to be defined in tasks.py to run the scripts on a weekly basis. Use docker compose logs to debug. 
            One of the main errors I get when running it is that it has a problem loading static files which leads me to believe in the docker-entrypoint.sh there could be a problem with this line: “python manage.py collectstatic –noinput”

    <section id="database">
        <h2>The Database</h2>
        <p>
            The Postgres database has nine different tables. All of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>. The <i>Coach</i> and <i>Cybercoach</i> tables store the coach data for the Cybercoach 
            select feature of the website. The <i>Subscriber</i> table stores all information about a subscriber. The <i>User</i> table is Django’s built-in User feature. This table stores similar 
            information to Subscriber, however, the user table is used for login/out, as well as keeping track of user betting and user credits. The <i>Game</i> and <i>GameScore</i> tables 
            store all information needed about a game for the betting feature. The information that is stored on each of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>. The <i>Bet</i>, 
            <i>BettingTransaction</i>, and <i>UserCredit</i> tables are used to keep track of the bets that users make, if they won, lost, or pushed the bet, and adjust credits. 
            The information that is stored on each of these tables can be found in <i>models.py</i>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="forms">
        <h2>The Forms</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>Subscriber</i> form was kept very similar to the original form. The only new feature is that the form now adds a user to the <i>User</i> table 
            and assigns that user with credits in the <i>UserCredits</i> table. All of this is done automatically when a user signs up on the website. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="views">
        <h2>The Views</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>login_view()</b>: view was added for the new login page. This view uses Django’s built-in user authentication feature. 
                The view limits the user to 5 login attempts and will lock the user out of their account for 5 minuets if they exceed these attempts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>profile_view()</b>: view was added to display all of the user’s information on the profile page. This view is only accessible if the user is logged in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>place_bets()</b>: view was added to display all of the games that a user can bet on. This will be displayed on the place bets page.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>place_bet()</b>: view is called when a user submits a bet. This view will put all of the necessary information for that user’s bet in the database.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="scripts">
        <h2>The Scripts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Populate_games.py</b>: is a script that is used to populate all the games and the data needed for betting in the database. 
                This script makes calls to the College Football Database (CFBDB) and the Odds-API. The API keys for both should be in your .env file. 
                Variable names and how to pull information for each of these APIs can be found in the documentation of their corresponding websites.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Update_scores.py</b>: is a script that is used to all the scores for each game and adjust the credits for each user. 
                This script should be run at the end of the week after all the games for that week have been played. This script only uses the CFBDB API. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>


    <section id="cybercoaches-and-coach-stats">
        <h2>Cybercoaches and Coach Stats</h2>
        <p>
        Cybercoaches are machine learning models that the client trained on College Football data. Essentially, given a scenario, they predict whether the coach would call a pass or rush play.
        On the website, users can navigate to the cybercoach_select.html page, select a cybercoach, and then select a real year/game/drive that the coach coached, or make a custom scenario. Then, they click submit, and see what the ML model predicts the coach would run.
        If they select a real drive, the page passes the coach, year, game, and drive to the prediction.html page through a POST request. The prediction in views.py handles getting the actual data and outputting it to the page.
        Similarly, if the user makes a custom scenario, the page makes a POST request to custom_prediction.html. Information about the backend communicating with the frontend can be seen in the views.py file and the django variables in the HTML pages.
        These are in script tags and not in the separate JS file because it broke when the Django variables were in the JS files.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few notes about this page: the page refreshes when a new cybercoach is selected because it has to pull the data for it. It does not refresh when a year or drive is selected because I pull in all the drives as an array when a cybercoach is chosen.
            The "custom scenario" form on the left has some formatting done through javascript as soon as the page loads. This is because I wanted the page to look different, but I could not directly change parts of the form because it is being generated from forms.py with Django.
            Please see the comments in the code to understand how it works more in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coach stats is pretty self explanatory, but I need to note that there is some JS for it in the navbar.js file. This is because when you initially click the coach stats header to go to the page, it shows an empty form, and Django sort of freaks out if the form doesn't have a selection.
            To fix this, I made it so that selecting a coach refreshes the page with the new coach selected, then everything works normally. This is in navbar.js because coach_stats.js wouldn't load until a coach is selected.
            Similarly, there were some weird things happening with the footer on that page when a coach hasn't been selected yet, so there is some conditional formatting through JavaScript on navbar.js because it always loads.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="place-bets">
        <h2>Place Bets</h2>
        <p>
        The place bets page pulls games from the database and displays bets to be made by the user. The user can select one (parlays are not implemented) and place a bet. The main thing to note is that the populate_games.py
        and update_scores.py are required to update the database with new games and game scores. This should be run weekly and ideally scheduled. I tried to
        implement error handling to prevent edge cases of users cheating. For example, if a game starts while they are on the page, they will not be able to bet on it.
        This just checks if the game start time is after their machine time. However, this means they could adjust their machine clock and bet on a game that has already happened.
        This is a rare edge case, but it should be fixed by the next group to prevent users cheating. Some sort of global clock API or database flag could fix it.
        When a bet is placed, it calls the place_bet action in views.py. There are comments to explain more of the JS in the files.
